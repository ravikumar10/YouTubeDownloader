# YouTubeDownloader

Due to windows file saving/creation criteria , tool was throwing an error of "INVALID arguements" , as it's not able to save the file name which is taken directly from title of the youtube video.
This is happening because of the presence of the quantifiers,spaces etc.

In the new .exe all the changes are included.
